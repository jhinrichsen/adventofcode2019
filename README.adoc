== Day 10: Monitoring Station

Optimized asteroid visibility detection by replacing expensive floating-point operations with integer-based GCD normalization.

.Key changes
- Replaced `complex128` coordinates with integer `Asteroid{X, Y int}` struct
- Part 1: GCD-based direction normalization instead of `cmplx.Polar()` and `math.Atan2()`
- Part 2: Squared distance for sorting (avoiding `math.Sqrt()`), simplified vaporization algorithm
- Eliminated `cmplx.Abs()` calls in hot path

== Day 19: Tractor Beam

Part 2 required multiple algorithmic iterations to find the correct approach:

**Failed approaches:**
- Attempt 1: Checking bottom-right corner instead of top-right
- Attempt 2: Checking both top-right and bottom-left from top-left corner
- Attempt 3: Optimization that incorrectly skipped beam points

**Successful approach:**
- Scan rows as the BOTTOM edge of the 100x100 square
- For each row y, find the leftmost beam point (bottom-left corner)
- Check if the top-right corner at (x+99, y-99) is also in the beam
- Return the top-left corner coordinates (x, y-99)

This approach works because the tractor beam expands monotonically, making a
row-by-row bottom-edge scan both correct and efficient.

== Day 22: Slam Shuffle

=== Part 2 Integer Overflow Bug

*Problem*: Initial implementation produced incorrect answer (69676926565412, too high).

*Root Cause*: Integer overflow in modular multiplication when handling large deck size (119315717514047).

*Where*: The `modMul` function was using direct multiplication `(a % m) * (b % m) % m`, which overflows when both operands are close to the modulus value. Since int64 max ≈ 9.2×10^18 and the deck size is ≈ 1.2×10^14, multiplying two values near the deck size exceeds int64 capacity.

*Why It Failed*: During matrix exponentiation in `powerTransform`, coefficients `a` and `b` grow to values near the deck size. When `modMul(a, currA, mod)` is called with both values ≈ 10^14, the intermediate result ≈ 10^28 overflows, producing incorrect results due to two's complement wraparound.

*Fix*: Implemented binary multiplication (peasant multiplication) for large values:
- Fast path: Direct multiplication for values < 1 billion (guaranteed no overflow)
- Slow path: Binary multiplication using repeated addition and doubling for large values
- Similar to how modular exponentiation avoids overflow using repeated squaring

*Impact*:
- Incorrect answer: 69676926565412
- Correct answer: 58348342289943
- All 4 example tests passed (deck size 10, small enough to avoid overflow)
- Issue only manifested with Part 2's large deck size

*Tests Added*:
- `TestDay22InverseLogic`: Validates inverse transformation for all 4 examples
- `TestDay22MultipleShuffles`: Verifies power transform with 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 shuffles

*Key Lesson*: When implementing modular arithmetic algorithms for competitive programming:
1. Always consider overflow even when using modulo operations
2. Test with actual problem constraints, not just examples
3. Binary multiplication is essential for large moduli (> √(int64_max))
